# PAGSA Software Plumbing: Basic Python

The files in this repository are for the first Software Plumbing workshop of 2019 on Basic Python. The presentation is a reduced version of an advanced Python workshop that William Thompson gave last year at the University of Victoria for the Software Plumbing series. The matplotlib basics notebook was created by Logan Francis during the introduction to plotting workshop last year.
